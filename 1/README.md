While Loop
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
They are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

Syntax - while (condition) {
             // code to be executed
         }
Write a program which does the following

Declare a variable 
a
a and initialise it to 0
Use the syntax above to create a loop, output the following to the console
Print 
a
a in separate lines as long as it is less than 7.
Increment 
a
a by 1 in each iteration.
